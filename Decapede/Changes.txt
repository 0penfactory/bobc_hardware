Changes
========

1. Change P1 power connector to 5.08 pitch. Move fuse holder and reset switch.
   Add separate connector for fan/aux output.
2. Thermistors connect to +5V
3. Footprints for optional latching connectors 0.1" KK (heaters, thermistors)
4. Use the Arduino R3 shield layout
5. Make sure thermistors are on ADC inputs. All FET outputs on PWM pins. 
   Rearrange other connections for easier layout.
6. Don't backfeed 5V to Arduino - jumper option to power Arduino via VIN

7. 10uf elco on thermistors to ceramic, Change 1206 resistors to 0805

8. Separate logic voltage from 5V in preparation for Due.

9. Change 1206/1210 on gate drivers resistors to 0805, remove apparently unneeded 
     components (2 resistors + zener).
     Add pull down on control inputs

10. Add LEDs for power, FET outputs

11. Separate ground for analog

12. Due "ready", just change one resistor on LM317
13. More copper in power/ground zone fills
14. Add connectors for SPI, I2C1

TODO:
======

-  1k on thermistors?
-. Ability to run off 12V? [Use 9V regulator instead of 12V]
-. jumper bypass for ADC?
-. Uprate 12V regulator to 1A 
-. Change endstops to 0V + signal (active low)?
-. bulk caps for 12V

-. 7.62mm connectors for power?

Due issues
----------
-. No SPI connector so can't use SD card
