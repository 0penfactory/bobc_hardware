Fixes for V1.0 Board:
Add pull-ups to primary I2C to equal 5.6K per BeagleBone SRM
Fix footprint for C1001, should be 0805 chip capacitor
Join adjacent screw terminals (P101/P107, P403/P405/P218/P219) on natural pitch (5.0mm or 3.5mm)
Increase screw terminal pin clearance around BBB P1 (5V DC Power Jack)
IPC nominal footprints and silk-screen for SMT components:

  ...too bad KiCAD has no assembly or courtyard layers :(
Fix component attributes so VALUE field does not separate parts of the same type
  Using the Value field to name connectors makes working with the BOM *PAINFUL*
Re-annotate to get sane reference designators?  
  Depends on if KiCAD can properly handle migrating the updates to the PCB
  ...or if the updates can fairly easily be propogated by directly editing the PCB file
Split BeagleBone part into two connectors, so it shows up properly on the BOM
Re-work the Pololu sheets so the 24-pin socket connectors appear on the BOM
Add fuses and part numbers to the BOM, not just the fuse sockets
Make sure parts that should be on the back of the board are actually *PLACED* on the back of the board
