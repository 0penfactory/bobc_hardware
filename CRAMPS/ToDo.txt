Fixes for V1.0 Board:
Schematic Updates:
  Add pull-ups to 3.3V for primary I2C to equal 5.6K per BeagleBone SRM
  Fix component attributes so VALUE field does not separate parts of the same type
    Using the Value field to name connectors makes working with the BOM *PAINFUL*
  Re-annotate to get sane reference designators?  
    Depends on if KiCAD can properly handle migrating the updates to the PCB
    ...or if the updates can fairly easily be propogated by directly editing the PCB file
  Split BeagleBone part into two connectors, so it shows up properly on the BOM
  Re-work the Pololu sheets so the 24-pin socket connectors appear on the BOM
  Add fuses and part numbers to the BOM, not just the fuse sockets
  Consistent polarity on screw terminal connections
    Leave main power inputs as-is
    Fix 5V power and switched outputs to match
  Fix EEPROM Address
    A2 should be tied high!
    A0 and/or A1 should have a way to set to high or low
  Add shorting jumpers to BOM? (used for setting microsteps, bypassing estop, etc)
    (25) TE 382811-8
  Fix ADC protection circuitry, which is currently affecting ADC readings
-   R1003 should be 2.610K (typo when entring values from TI TLV431 spreadsheet)
-   Remove TLV431 and just use 1.8V for clamp voltage?
-   Switch to dual diodes with better knee for clamping?
    Remove protection entirely, and just rely on series resistor?
  Add LEDs for BeagleBone power on, machine power on, ???
    ...gotta spend the $$$ saved on dropping the TLV431 on something!  :)
  Modify stepper enable drive so it is never driven to 5V?
    Allegro A4988 and TI DRV8825 are fine with 5V signals when running on 3.3V
    ...but some other parts or uses might need consistent 3.3V levels?
  Incorporate Alexander Rossler's suggestions from a schematic review:
    Fix the "direction" of schematic labels: ESTOP, SDA, SDA-5V
    Fix 12V comment (only used for LP MOSFETs, not Due/Mega or gate voltage)

PCB Updates:
- Fix footprint for C1001, should be 0805 chip capacitor (removed)
  Join adjacent screw terminals (P101/P107, P403/P405/P218/P219) on natural pitch (5.0mm or 3.5mm)
  Increase screw terminal pin clearance around BBB P1 (5V DC Power Jack)
  IPC nominal footprints and silk-screen for SMT components:
    http://landpatterns.ipc.org/default.asp
    ...too bad KiCAD has no assembly or courtyard layers :(
  Make sure parts that should be on the back of the board are actually *PLACED* on the back of the board
    BeagleBone P8
    BeagleBone P9
    BeagleBone Serial Console
  Shrink board to smaller than 100mm x 100mm
  Move ATX power-on connector near 5V screw terminal?

x = done
- = don't implement
  = ToDo
