Schematic Updates:
  4 Stepper drivers
  2 high-current FETs
  2 thermistor inputs
  Add thermocouple input
  Remove AT power-on header
  Remove resistive touch-screen header
? Remove serial debug header
  Combine all power inputs to single 12-24V rail
  Switch to smaller fuse 
  Add 5V regulator for BBB
  Switch low-power FETs to part that can handle 24V
  Charge-pump enable circuit
? On-board DRV8825 drivers with programmable current control


PCB Updates:
  Make PCB smaller, if possible
  Add mounting holes
? Move BBB to top side of board (for easier assembly)
    Makes PCB assembly easier (parts only on one side of PCB)
    Reduces available space for connectors
